<p align="center">n8n <a href="https://www.n8n.io">nodes</a> to trigger workflows from Discord or send interactive messages. <br>
Uses the components API which allows to create dialogs (e.g. attach buttons and wait for the user to click on them).</p>

<p align="center">These nodes do not use webhooks but a Discord bot to enable two-way communication. <br>
The bot automatically launches into a main process once configured and transmits or receives data from child processes when a node is executed.</p>

## How to install

### Community Nodes (Recommended)

1. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-discord` in **Enter npm package name**.
4. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source**.
5. Select **Install**.

After installing the node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel.

### Manual installation

To get started install the package in your n8n root directory:

`npm install n8n-nodes-discord`

For Docker-based deployments, add the following line before the font installation command in your [n8n Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile):

`RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-discord`

## Bot setup

In order to send, listen to messages, get the list of channels or roles, you need to setup a bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

First, create an application by clicking on **New Application** in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Go to **OAuth2** and copy the client ID. On your n8n instance, you will create new Discord App credentials (**Credentials > New > Search for "Discord App" > Continue**) and paste the Client ID into the corresponding field. Don't close yet the modal.

Get back to the Discord Developer Portal on your created application, go to **Bot** and click **Add Bot**. In the **Authorization Flow**, disable **Public Bot**. Activate all **Privileged Gateway Intents** then save your modifications.

![](images/bot-1.png)

Go to **OAuth > URL Generator**, select the scopes **bot** and **applications.commands**, the bot permission **administrator** then copy the generated URL at the bottom.

![](images/url-gen.png)

Now use this link to add the bot to your Discord server. You need to be logged in to Discord on the browser with the same account where you have **Manage Server** or **Administrator** permissions on the server you want to add the bot.

Once your bot is added to your server, you need to get the bot token and add it to your Discord App credentials. Just click on **Copy** on yout bot page or **Reset Token** if the button **Copy** is not visible.

![](images/credentials-2.png)

Save your credentials and got to **Settings > n8n API**, click **Create an API Key** or select the existing one, copy the key, reopen your Discord App credentials (**Credentials > Open**), paste the key into the **n8n API key** field and set your base URL (e.g. https://n8n.example.com/api/v1). Don't forget to save again.

Now you will be able to use the **Discord Trigger** and **Discord Send** nodes on your workflows. The first time you setup one of these nodes, it will start the bot.

## Discord Trigger Node Reference

- **Credential for Discord App**: If you followed the bot setup guide above, you will be able to select your Discord App credentials to start the bot. If you are already another Discord Trigger (or Send) node, be careful to select the same credentials. It's not meant at the moment to be used with multiple Discord Server.
- **Listen to**: Let you select the text channels you want to listen to for triggering the workflow. If none selected, all channels will be listen to. Your credentials must be set and the bot running, you also need at least one text channel available. If you do not meet these requirements, make the changes then close and reopen the modal (the channels list is loaded when the modal opens). For "User" trigger types, if you want to use a placeholder, select the channel where you want it displayed.
- **From roles**: The same logic apply here for roles, except it is optional. If you don't select any role it will listen to **@everyone**.
- **Trigger type**: Type of event to listen to. User events must specify a channel to listen to if you want to use a placeholder or the option "send to the trigger channel" in a Discord Send node.
  - **Message**: Listen to messages sent in the selected channels.
  - **Command**: Listen to commands sent in the selected channels.
  - **Interaction**: Listen to persisted button/select.

- **From roles**: When listening to user role update, select which removed or added role needs to be matched.
- **Message ID**: If trigger type interaction. The message ID of the button/select to listen to.
- **Pattern**: Message only. Select how the value below will be recognized. âš  Keep in mind that the value will be tested with all mentions removed and a trim applied (whitespaces removed at the beginning and at the end). For example `@bot hello` will be tested on `hello`.

## Commands

To help you create and debug your workflow with Discord Trigger/Send nodes, some commands have been registered to the bot.

- `/logs`: Display the last logs stored in memory (max 100).
  - **With parameters**
    - `/logs 10`: If you specify a number, it will display the number amount last logs.
    - `/logs clear`: Remove all logs in memory.
    - `/logs on`: Logs are automatically sent in the current channel.
    - `/logs off`: Disable logs automatically sent in the channel.
- `/clear`: Remove last (max 100) messages in the current channel.
  - **With parameters**
    - `/clear 10`: If you specify a number, it will remove the number amount last messages.
- `/test`: Toggle the test mode. Test mode switch the Discord bot on the trigger test url. Useful if you want to see how a workflow is executed and data are passed. Once the test mode is activated, go to the Discord Trigger UI and click on **Fetch Test Event** then on Discord send a message to trigger the workflow.
  - **With parameters**
    - `/test true`: Activate the test mode.
    - `/test false`: Disable the test mode.

## Troubleshooting

- There is a [known issue](https://github.com/edbrdi/n8n-nodes-discord/issues/10) with the updating process or some new install resulting in the Discord icon missing (nodes not recognized). To fix this issue, you just need to restart n8n.
- If you can't update the nodes through the UI, try to uninstall and reinstall them.
- Before raising an issue, make sure you have configured the bot properly (especially the permissions) and your triggers are activated. You can't test a non-activated trigger.
